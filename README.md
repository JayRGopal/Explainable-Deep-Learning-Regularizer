# Reg-Explain
Evaluating the impact of regularization on explainability

A custom-built simple CNN has been coded via PyTorch to aid in this endeavor.

Additionally, Resnet50 is being used. It is being trained via code from the PyTorch-Image-Models (TIMM) repository.

The dataset being used is CIFAR10.

RESULTS (Test Accuracy):
Resnet50-Dropout: 96.34%
Resnet50-L2: 96.42%
